# Loan Approval Prediction:

An End-to-End Machine learning project which predicts whether an individual is eligible to be approved for his loan based on various personal and financial factors like his marital status,profession, etc.

-> Complete Classification ML model using various algorithms like logistic regression, xgboost, K-nearest neighbour and Artificial Neural Network(ANN), etc.

### ðŸš€ Features

- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature scaling.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing key insights about loan applicants.
- Feature Engineering: Transforming raw data into meaningful features.
- Model Selection & Training: Comparing multiple classification algorithms.
- Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimizing model performance.
- Model Evaluation: Assessing accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Deployment: Deploying the model using Flask/Streamlit.

### ðŸ“‚ Dataset
